# Testing

Respite encourages [Test Driven Development](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html)</a> and provides stubbed Test Cases for all scaffolded classes. Respite uses [ScalaTest](http://scalatest.org/) by default, but comes with DSL support for [Specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) should you want to use it instead.

<p class="message">
  For further reading on testing [Routes](/routing/) for ScalaTest, Specs2 or ScalaCheck, check the <a href="http://scalatra.org/2.3/guides/testing/scalatest.html">Testing</a> documentation on the Scalatra website.
